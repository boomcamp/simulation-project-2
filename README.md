# Simulation Project 2

<!-- ## Project Overview

For this simulation project you'll be building a cryptocurrency price explorer
and investment tracker.

To do this we'll utilize a free cryptocurrency API.
[coingecko.com/api](https://www.coingecko.com/api)

You can find the API documentation here
[coingecko API docs](https://www.coingecko.com/api/documentations/v3)

Part of the challenge of this project will be exploring the API and finding the
appropriate endpoints to utilize to build the required functionality. You won't
be required to use specific endpoints, utilize API endpoints that help you
accomplish the goals of each feature. -->
